# Build environment for Git for Windows

This is Git for Windows SDK, the build environment for [Git for Windows](http://git-for-windows.github.io/).

The easiest way to install Git for Windows SDK is via the [net installer](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/releases/latest). This installer will clone our [repositories](http://github.com/git-for-windows/), including all the necessary components to build Git for Windows, and perform an initial build.
